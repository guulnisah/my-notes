# Dependencies

`@nestjs/common` - Contains vast majority of functions, classes, etc, that we need from Nest

`@nestjs/core`

`@nestjs/platform-express` - Lets Nest use Express JS for handling HTTP requests

`reflect-metadata` - Helps make decorators work.

Nest relies upon some outside implementation to handle requests for it. So inside of our nest server we are going to have some place inside of our code where we have to plug in some kind of HTTP implementation.


# Creating a Nest module

In just about every HTTP server you're ever going to create, you're going to have a request response cycle.

The request response cycle almost always has the same steps inside of it, regardless of the language framework library or whatever else that you use to build your server.

The process may look something like this:
1. Validate data contained in the request
2. Make sure the user is authen-ticated
3. Route the request to a particular function
4. Run some business logic
5. Access a database


Then as a result of this entire process, we're going to formulate a response and send the response back to whoever made us the request.


So in NEST, we get special tools to help us address each of these very particular steps.

1. Pipes validate incoming data
2. Guards handle authentication
3. Controllers contain routing logic
4. Services contain business logic
5. Repositories handle data stored in a DB

Other parts of Nest
- Modules group code together
- Filters handle errors that occur during requeset handling
- Interceptors add extra logic to incoming requests or outgoing responses

To make the most simple basic app possible we need a Nest module and a controller.

# Controller

```js
@Controller()
// Tells nest that we are about to define a controller - something that has functions to handle incoming requests

class AppController { // A class that is going to handle and root incoming requests.

    @Get() // Tells nest to run this 'greeting' method anytime someone makes a GET request to 'localhost:3000/'
    
    getRootRoute() { // each method is designed to handle one kind of incoming request
        return 'hi there!' // Tells nest to send a string of 'hi there' back to whoever made the request to us
    }
}
```

One class per file (some exceptions)
Class names should include the kind of thing we are creating
Name of class and name of file should always match up
